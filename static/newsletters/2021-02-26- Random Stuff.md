Having the right tools as a developer will save you a lot of time on everything. Whether it’s producing code, checking data or validating commands and configurations, it quickly becomes indispensable. Here is my favorite folder, it took me several years to build this list!

Impossible for me to remember the syntax and snippets of the tools and languages I use. Besides, it’s useless since that’s not the important thing. The important thing is to remember the concepts, not the details. For details, cheatsheets are there for that, and [DevHints](https://devhints.io/) is the gold mine.

Learn [X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) is the kind of crazy site you have to see to believe. Every possible language, explained in one page, in almost every language, through concrete examples of code. From more than standard languages like C++ to infernal languages like LOLCODE you will find everything.

With the pandemic, my internet connection has become even more important than before. If there is a network outage or drop, I want to know immediately. Fortunately, Cloudflare has made [a page analyzing your connection](https://speed.cloudflare.com/) in great detail. With one click, it tells you everything about your current connection status. Handy to know what happens when your call lag or when nothing works anymore!

Before coding a complicated problem, I need to make a schematic. Believe me, nothing will save you more time than schematizing your ideas before coding. Most of the time, it’s paper/pencil. Otherwise, it’s [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/). Excalidraw is a whiteboard that allows you to easily draw your plan as if it were handmade! A blank page, enough to make diagrams and save them. Simple, fast, clean, free, incredible. A must.

This one is completely crazy! [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) is just free Photoshop in the browser. I frequently find myself retouching images for various reasons. No need to have the cheap free editing tools anymore. I just open a page and get it done. It’s very handy to do a quick trick from anywhere without installing all the junk. It’s amazing that it works so well and it’s free!
